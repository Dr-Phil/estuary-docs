# Introduction

Estuary is the most reliable and simple way to upload public data to the Filecoin Network.

You can use this Estuary Node [(https://estuary.tech)](https://estuary.tech) that the [ARG](https://arg.protocol.ai) operates or you can run your own Estuary Node.

Estuary Nodes are a new type of network node. These nodes provide decentralized storage for all developers using it, and each node turns uploading data and retieving data into a simpler problem for everyone. Your users will not need any additional infrastructure.

Estuary Nodes depend on the [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) Network for presistent, interoperable, verifiable and provable decentralized storage. Estuary Nodes use IPFS and other [protocols](https://github.com/application-research/estuary/blob/master/main.go) for content addressing and cached retrievals.

#### Getting started

- Visit the [website](https://estuary.tech) to upload files to our hosted Estuary node.
- Try our API, here.

#### Limitations?

- A maximum of 32 GB per upload.
- The service is temporarily invite only to people with meaningful public data.
- Miners can not be selective of the data they will receive, yet.

### Why would I use https://estuary.tech?

If you are a human who wants to upload public data sets to the internet, our Estuary Node is a solution to that problem.

- Go to [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- Create an account with your [invite key](https://docs.estuary.tech/get-invite-key).
- Drag and drop a file or select one from your machine.
- Wait a few seconds.

Success! You have uploaded a file to the [Filecoin Network](https://filecoin.io) and you can retrieve that content address from any IPFS gateway.

### As a developer, why would I use the API provided by https://estuary.tech?

If you are a developer who wants to use Filecoin storage, our API is a solution to that problem.

- Make sure you have some basic software development skills, starting with a language that you like to use (Examples: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Go, Rust, C++, Java).
- Go to [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- Create an account with your [invite key](https://docs.estuary.tech/get-invite-key).
- [Follow our tutorial](https://docs.estuary.tech/tutorial-get-an-api-key).

Congrats! Now your application can store and retrieve a file on the Filecoin Network whenever you like.

### As a network operator, why would I run my own Estuary infrastructure?

If you are a network operator like [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud), [Fission](https://fission.codes/) or [Textile](https://www.textile.io/) and you want to run your own Estuary nodes, our open source code is the solution to your problem.
