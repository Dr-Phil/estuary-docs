# Listing your files

After you have [uploaded a file](https://docs.estuary.tech/tutorial-uploading-your-first-file). You will probably want to list all of your files. To do so just copy and paste your API key into the code example on the right.

Once you do so, here is an example of the output:

```
{
  "id": 16,
  "cid": "QmTMBh4bCQFgzr1fTCjVb5pRBUe7v9673HTLZWh77sUHUx",
  "name": "nasa-space-settlements-a-design-study.pdf",
  "userId": 3,
  "description": "",
  "size": 30886087,
  "active": true,
  "offloaded": false,
  "replication": 6,
  "aggregatedIn": 0,
  "aggregate": false
}
```

You can use the CID to retrieve the file immediately by using an IPFS Gateway.

### You are done

You have successfuly put data on the Filecoin Network and you can get a list of the data that will be replicated across Filecoin miners. Check out the rest of our API documentation to learn what else you can do with your API key.
