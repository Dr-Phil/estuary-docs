# What is Estuary?

We made an easy way to upload and retrieve files.

But if you care about more than that, the purpose of Estuary is to make it way easier to make [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) storage deals and retrieve your files. However we acknowledge that some people don't care about [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) and just want a place to store public data.

We hear you loud and clear!

- We provide hosted infrastructure that you can use to upload your files. You don't have to run any code, but you can if you want to. What does this mean? There is a [website](https://estuary.tech) you can visit to upload a file.
- You may learn more about how [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) works while using this website. But you can upload your public data without having to understand how it works.
- Files are uploaded using [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP). [CURL](https://curl.se/) also works from the command line. Don't know what this means? Don't worry.

### Limitations?

- 32 GB Maximum per upload per Filecoin storage deal, for now.
- Temporarily invite only.
- Miners can not be selective of the data they will receive, yet.
- You can not remove deals or pinned content, yet.

- Coming soon.
- Follow development [here](https://github.com/application-research/estuary).

## Why? What does this solve?

We wanted to create a way that made it easy to upload data to the [Filecoin Network](https://filecoin.io). It is as simple as that.

When we make it easy to upload data to the Filecoin Network, the user and all of the miners that participate with this Estuary node benefit. Thats good for everyone invovled.

- All of the miners we work with are located on this [API documentation page](https://docs.estuary.tech/api-public-miners) and on the bottom of [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- All of our stats are publicly available on this [API documentation page](https://docs.estuary.tech/api-public-stats) or visible from [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- You can find custom miner pages for each miner on [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).

### I am still confused

We will release a YouTube video to explain how we created a website to help you upload files for long term storage on the internet. Meanwhile you can check out [this tutorial](https://docs.estuary.tech/tutorial-get-an-api-key) if you're a developer and want to get started.
