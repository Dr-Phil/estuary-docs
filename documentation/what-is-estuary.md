# What is Estuary

The purpose of Estuary is to make it easy to make Filecoin storage deals. However we acknowledge that some people don't care about Filecoin and just want a place to store public data.

We hear you loud and clear.

- We provide hosted infrastructure that you can use to make Filecoin storage deals. You don't have to run any code, but you can if you want to.
- We provide a website where you can use a simple HTTP based experience to upload files and learn how Filecoin works. That website is: [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).

## Why? What does this solve?

We wanted to create a way that made it easy to upload data to the Filecoin Network. It is as simple as that.

When we make it easy to upload data to the Filecoin Network, the user and all of the miners that participate with this Estuary node benefit. Thats good for everyone invovled.

- All of the miners we work with are located on this [API documentation page](https://estuary.tech/api-public-miners) and on the bottom of [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- All of our stats are publicly available on this [API documentation page](https://estuary.tech/api-public-stats) or visible from [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
- You can find custom miner pages for each miner on [https://estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech).
